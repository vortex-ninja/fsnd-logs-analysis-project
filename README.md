# fsnd-logs-analysis-project


### Overview
This is the third project in Full Stack Developer Nanodegree course.
It is a python program that connects to a database and retrieves data to create logs.
Results are formatted and presented in console in plain text.



### How To Use
1. Follow instructions on [udacity/database-info](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd004/parts/8d3e23e1-9ab6-47eb-b4f3-d5dc7ef27bf0/modules/bc51d967-cb21-46f4-90ea-caf73439dc59/lessons/262a84d7-86dc-487d-98f9-648aa7ca5a0f/concepts/a9cf98c8-0325-4c68-b972-58d5957f1a91)
   to prepare virtual environment and database.
2. Add views from `newsviews.sql` file from this repository.
   You can use `psql -d news -f newsviews.sql` to do that.
3. Run `log.py`.



### Example Output
You can find example output in `output.txt` file.



### Database Views
Views that were added by me to the database and are required for the program to run successfully are in the file
`newsviews.sql`. They are also included in comments, with comments :) in `logdb.py` file.
